        Epollo is a service that helps students with Computer Science, Emglish,
        and Math. Users can open their own courses or follow courses, ask questions,
        and answer questions and earn points. It uses OCR(Optical Character Recognition)
        technology to digitalise the texts, and ask people to participate by giving them
        tasks to whether the program read the text right or not and reward them.

        course card, it expands and shows the modules. Green check icon means the
