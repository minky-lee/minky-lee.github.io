        The issue of abandoned animals, especially dogs,
        is a very serious problem intertwined with the problem of
        'puppy factory' where they abuse dogs to get cute puppies of the dog breeds
        people prefer, and with the problem of dog farm. People 'buy' 2-3 months old
        cute puppies from pet shops which are supplied from the puppy factories
        without considering what it takes to have a dog as a family or how to take
        care of them.
        And when their dogs start acting in a way they don't like, they easily abandon them.
        It is more likely for the dogs from the puppy factories to act abnormally because
        they are detatched from their mothers in such an early and crucial stage of socialisation.
        Some of them end up in public shelters which is already highly overcrowded.

          Paw in Hand
        </a>
        is a mobile application service founded by a vetarinarian in South Korea,
        which is to help people find their lost animals and to promote
        adoption of shelter animals. It provides data from shelters all over the
        country on a mobile application. A lot of people have found their new family
        through this app including my friend. I check this app regulrarly myself,
        and found that the design of this service can be a little confusing. There are
        too many steps to get to the information I want, and the identity design doesn't
        have consistency. It's icon in apple appstore was in green, but the logotype
        in the actual app was orange, and the main colour on the website was pink.
        <br>I started with designing a new identity for the service. I wasted to
        show the feeling of warmth and care, so I chose warm yellow as the main colour.
        And tried various ways to make the logotype look like cushions with heavy Bold weight.

        And then I made some plans of how I want to reorganise the system of This
        service on paper, used apple numbers to design the Information Architecture.
        When I launch the app for the first time, there were just too much Informations such as
        news from events from the app, or news that related to shelter animals,
        and journals from people who adopted animals from shelter through this app.
        I thought this app should concentrate to promote adoption of shelter animals
        and help finding lost animals. But I kept the menus for community, since it's
        an effective tool to let people know that the shelter dogs, especially
        the ones that doesn't have specific breed, are just as good as the others.

      <p class="text">
        Next, using Sketch IOS library, I made some wireframes to map out the structure
        visually. This could be changed during the process, but it helps to concentrate
        on the visual structure. There is another time for thinking about the graphics.
        Current app has both hamburger menu and tap menu on top. I changed it into
        bottom tap menu. They are home, shelter, volunteering, community and benefits for
        the occational discounts and cupons to encourage participation.

      <p class="text">
        And then I moved on to the grapics, starting with the icons for each tap menu.
        I used bold lines to match with the logotype and to make it easier to distinguish
        when put on tiny menu. Activated ones are with yellow and black, and deactivated
        ones are gray.

      <p class="text">
        Then I move on to the actual GUI design, first the launch and sign in.
        I simplified the step by removing the extra step that contains multiple
        news information and 'start paw in hand' button, and used card view of
        the vounteer schedules and updates of animals that I 'saved'. If it's the
        first time the app is launched, it shows the informations of volunteer schedules
        that are close to the deadline and animals that don't have much time. Statistics on the
        number of rescued animals still can be seen on the yellow 'show statistics of this month' menu on top.

      <p class="text">
        In the profile section, There are three taps for saved activities, animals, and
        the contents that you've uploaded. You can also edit your profile by adjusting
        toggle settings to turn on/off the notifications for volunteer activity, missing
        animal alert, fundings. There is also a toggle switch that shows whether you're
        planning to adopt or not.

      <img src="../Images/pawinhand/PIH_9_profile.png" alt="paw in hand app design" class="content_img">

      <p class="text">
        When you start the adoption process, you can see the yellow 'Adoption process
        going on' alert. When you tap and go inside that menu, there is an overview
        of the entire adoption process.

      <p class="text">
        Moving on to 'shelter' tap, where you can see the lists of animals in the shelter
        from all over the country. You can align the list items according to the reigon,
        the date they came in to the shelter, and the species. When you tap the list item,
        it shows the detail of the animal such as appearance, weight, colour. You can also
        see the location of the shelter they're in, and there is a button to make inquieries
        on the animal.

      <p class="text">
        And in the community tab, you can either send a notification when you see an animal
        that looks like it's lost or put up a post when you lost yours. On both occasion,
        the map data is also provided so that you can pinpoint the spot where you lost/ saw
        the animal. You can also share the page to let wider range of people know.
