      <p id="brief">
        This brief asks you to engage with the potential value of not knowing things.
        You will explore the ways in which secrets might form the basis of positive, useful or creative design strategies.
        You are asked to make things with, around or for hidden elements within society and culture, without exposing the secrets themselves.
        The aim is not to deny the negative or harmful effects of secrecy, but to look for areas where secret or hidden knowledge can generate positive or playful engagements.
      </p>


      <p class="text">I was talking about the brief during the end of term tutorial.
        Since my first term project was about the ways to make our everyday scenery into codes, I was going to expand that topic and research secret code languages.
        My tutor suggested me to look into Bletchley park, and I remember I loved the drama Bletchley circle.
        A top secret code breaking institution with female dominated population? Yes please. This project must be fun.

      <p class="text">I hate wasting time and unmanaged schedule, so I started my research right away with reading papers and books, and actually visiting the place. From the books I was reading, I collected interviews from the veterans on post-it notes. They became the shape of some sort of a climbing plant on my desk.

         They were highly segmented organisation. Most of the people who worked there didn’t know about where their work came from or where it goes. They were forbidden to talk about their work to anyone, including their family or co-workers in different hut. Many of them were hesitant to talk about it even after the war was ended. And even though the high-profile positions were filled with men, about 70 per cent of the workforce who worked there were women. Some women WERE involved with the jobs that considered ‘more important’. And all of the stories from the veterans were fascinating. When they found a possible candidate, they ran a background check and without explaining anything, the women had to report to Bletchley park (also known as station X) and sign the Official Secerets Act. Many of them describe the atmosphere very sombre and serious, giving them an impression that if they say anything about this place, they could go to jail or be executed.

         Although the idea of secret codebreaking job sounds very exciting, it seemed most part of the job was repetitive and boring, especially when you don’t know what these jobs are for. There were people who tapped into the enemy morse code traffic all over UK and abroad, and people who delivered them to the park, and people who registered them, and people who decoded them and people who translated them. Quite a lot of the interviews were saying the work itself was dull and tiring and the environment they were working in was not good. But many of them seemed like they were eager to contribute to the war effort, and did their best in their position, even though they were not told anything or allowed to question anything. There were some odd sentimentality around there. I guess that’s what war does to people.

         There were some dramatic stories too, like the story of Jean who was working as a decoder and found out one morning that the Italians were going to attack. She informed her superior and could mitigate the attack, but later, she learns that most of the casualties from this operation were women and children. Mavis Batey was going to apply for the nurse training program, but her professor suggested her to go to Bletchley park, and she played an important role there.

         I thought I could say this was a chain of women doing their own works, not aware of the process, or each others existence, but still form a bigger process of doing something. Like a small part of a machine.
         My tutor told me about her experience when she was working at a laundry facility, repetitively doing her part of the job without understanding what’s before of after her part of the job.

         I was a bit lost at this point. I knew I wanted to find a way of re-enacting this chain, but couldn’t find the way I felt right. At first, I tried to do that literally by coding one of the interview texts with simplified way of enigma, and give it to different women and decode it.

         But then I came up with the idea of animation production. Traditional hand-drawn animations are made of drawings, 12, 24, or 30 frames per second. If put individually, they are just drawings, but if you flip them fast, they make animations. I started drawing simple animations that can go with the contents of the interviews I collected, and gave it to different women to trace it and add some drawings on top of it, and then sign it.

         By this point I had about three weeks until the end of the project, so it was a hectic schedule. I made basically all of my female classmates to participate, and went to the library to collect more. One of my tutors kindly let me come into her lecture and collect the drawings from her students.

         I made them into four parts of animation.

         For the final presentation, there were strict guidelines about what I can and can’t present as my outcome, and I had to persuade that apart from the animation, the drawings I collected were also an outcome. I thought the drawings put into a from of bound papers represents the ‘individual experience’ part of the project, while the animation is the whole process the individuals made. My tutor later added that by showing the drawings, it unfolds the labour that made the animation in a visible way when it’s in a sort of compressed form with the animation. And we all agreed the idea of making the participants to sign their name on the paper was a good one.

         This project also included 2000 words writing submission. I wrote a six piece short stories of six women in different position in Bletchley park. </p>
