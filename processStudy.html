        <p class="worktitle">UX design <br>Process Study</p>
        <p class="sort">2018 / UX / UI</p>

        <p class="text">
          in 2018, as a part of the UX course I was taking, I had to desgin a service of
          my choice. I spent a lot of time on watching films and dramas on streaming services,
          and was using couple of documentation / recommendation apps. They were susally good,
          but there were some parts that I didn't quite like such as the recommendation system
          and the star ratings. The recommendation system often recommended something I clearly
          wouldn't want to watch and I just didn't trust the star ratings. Plus, it was the time
          when people started talk about sexual harrasments on the production process, and
          people I know, including me, didn't want to consume something that came out of
          exploitation on women and the minority. So this is the persona I set.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          First I conducted some text based interview to see if my target users are feeling
          the same way. I mainly asked whether they feel the recommendation mechanism
          in the service they're using (mainly Netflix) is working, who's recommendation
          they trust when they're choosing to watch next, and if they want to know if there
          was any exploitation on the course of making the films and dramas. They answered
        </p>

        <li id="survey">
          <ul>They do feel the recommendation system doesn't work sometimes</ul>
          <ul>They usually trust recommendations from friends who's taste is simillar to their own</ul>
          <ul>They want to know it if there was sexual harrasments and exploitaions dring the production process</ul>
        </li>

        <p class="text">
          Based on the result of the survey I conducted and the persona I've set, I
          drew a journey map of the user. This might not be the perfect way to predict the
          behaviour of the user, but it helped me guessing what might be the most
          frustrating thing while they're trying to find what to watch.

          According to an online news article,
          <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-09-08/netflix-reccomendation-how-does-it-work/" class="reference_list">
            The secrets of Netflix’s recommendation system – and why it may not work for you</a>,
            it seems that at least in Netflix, even though the reccomendation system itself works in a way that makes sense, (which is
            to recommend something that's liked by other users who likes limillar things with you) the 'tags' that's
            attatched to each contents are still marked by their employees. So if what the user thinks about
            a content is different from what the certain Netflix employees think, the user ends up with some
            unsatisfactory recommendations. So what if I let the users to add tags?
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          <a href="https://therottenappl.es/" class="reference_list">
            Rotten apples</a> is a website where you can search a title of a film
            and see if there was any sexual misconduct during the production period.
            If there was no such accusation, it is shown as 'fresh apples'. If there
            was, it says 'rotten apples' and provides links of articles related to the
            accusation. If someone thinks that the accusation is false, they
            can contact the managers of the site. But to get all this information,
            the user has to find the website and search the film. What if I add a
            small feature in the service that lets the user know?
        </p>

        <img src="letterboxed.png" alt="user interviews" class="content_img">

        <p class="text">
          I also did some research on other applications for film documentation /
          recommendations. Letterboxed is one of the most popular. I liked how they
          organise the 'watched' films with posters. But when you go one depths
          further, it seems that there are
          too many information on one sight and need to set some hierarchy.

        <img src="imdb.png" alt="user interviews" class="content_img">

        <p class="text">
          Simillar problem with IMDB. They provide huge amounts of information,
          but need to organise them.
        </p>

        <img src="watcha.png" alt="user interviews" class="content_img">

        <p class="text">
          Watcha is the service that's most popular in South Korea. It stresses
          quite a lot on the star ratings and comments from the users. It also
          provides somewhat detailed analysis on the user's taste.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          Based on the researches and the main features I want to includes, I
          designed the Information Architecture and wireframes.
        </p>

        <img src="IA.png" alt="user interviews" class="content_img">
        <img src="ux-wireframe.png" alt="user interviews" class="content_img">

        <p class="text">
          And moved on to designing main pages. On the main page, the user can
          see recommended contents and the news articles related to that content,
          and they can add tags later on. The user also can create scrapbooks with
          interviews and movie clips and articles. With informations about each film
          / drama contents, the 'rotten apple' alert is shown.
        </p>
